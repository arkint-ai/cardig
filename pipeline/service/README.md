This is just an interface to show the analytics from the processing in ingestion and also include all the vital information to provide leverage to the user, hopefully without overwelming them, this can be improved with domain specific knowledge, looking at what our sources are doing, trying to do better and cleaner

Using numpy (speedup computation), pandas for processing analytics and matplotlib to build the graphics and serve them as images avoid javascript bs, is scipy needed? whats the advantage of pandas? is skikit needed?

Tools like tableau and powerbi provide interative apis and reports already and save us dev time

Also looker/lookml gives self service analytics for frontend queries without technical knowledge (wrap and serve this to user?)
