Clean up data and load to storage

Data will be raw and has to be trimmed and categorised into what really matter

Will come from scheduled spark jobs that run the scrapper scripts

Using apache airflow we can extract useful data for intelligence and analytics trasform and load it into storage

Further research into building good analytics is needed in order to better filter this data

Further domain research is needed to better understand this categorisation, but it can and should be improved over time for business intelligence
