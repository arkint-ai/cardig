This changes are sensed using scripts every x minutes (x=5? => have to balance computation cost against worth in market leverage, but the lower the better like 3s)

Scripts in Scala (play with demos and make it work for standvirtual)

Apache spark can run planned jobs (scripts) to aggregate data (batch processing) to feed to ingestion

Scrape logged bidding, buying and selling markets with premium subscriptions if provided, and free as much as possible and send to processing

Further research into spark is needed, hadoop and hive (all apache) are also alternatives?

Scrappers should scrape as much useful data for analytics and business intelligence, better more to process than less, for now, later we can fine tune this to save computation in processing
